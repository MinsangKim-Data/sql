**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

In my previous homeworks, I focused primarily on the technical aspect of data management, like creating and updating databases. However, from our discussions about ethics and inequity components during class, I feel that well-created databases-specifically the way that the database is structured- are crucial for complying with ethical standards in the data field. Especially since the data field is still burgeoning and the regulations are struggling to keep pace with its development, it is essential that we ensure that our data practices are fair, transparent, and respectful of individuals' privacy and rights.

One crucial area for improvement is the collection and use of data. As humans with access to vast amounts of information, we can easily make instant judgments based on our biases and lived experiences. This behavior can cloud our judgment and lead to incorrect or unfair decisions, especially if we are in positions of authority. Regardless of tenure or position, I think it is prudent for data to be compartmentalized and anonymized via an ID number or blockchain technology for there to be clear separation between the data and personal identifiers.This way we can focus on the insights derived from the data rather than the individuals behind it, whilst also complying with respecting their privacy.

As I mentioned earlier, the rules around the ethical and inequity components of data are still being developed, while varying greatly from country to country. The landscape is shifting quickly, and I believe that as data practioners we must be very prudent about how we go about managing and collecting data so we can have the knowledge and understanding to develop the proper frameworks and future rules and regulations that govern the data space. With more awareness and education to the public about their data, we can make everyone more "on-board" about how data practioners use data and how best the public can manage theirs.
